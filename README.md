Creative Corner was created in a group effort to help eliminate the struggles of an artist going through writer's or an overall creative block. The user will be able to search using a key word that will display images and a relative quote that can be used to spark creativity. The user will also be able to "favorite" the images they found most helpful, and those images will be saved to a "Favorite's Page."


This application was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, The MET & Dictum APIs, along with Ui Kit Framework. It uses client-side storage to store data and is interractive to user imput.
